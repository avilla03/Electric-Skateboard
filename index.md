# About Me
Hello! My name is Andrew Villapudua, a second year student at UC San Diego. I am currently studying Math-CS in John Muir College. I am a student-athlete in both Cross Country and Track & Field. In my time moving from Los Angeles where I grew up, to moving down to San Diego for college, I had time to develop hobbies such as surfing and skating. 
# Overview
Over the course of a few months, I plan on forming, developing, and executing a plan to build a functioning electric skateboard. This project aims to challenge my researching skills, problem-solving ability, and hardware knowledge I have developed over the past few years in school.
# Research
With a price range in mind, I chose to work with electric skateboards in the range of 400-600 dollars, as I assumed it would be less expsensive to assemble a board on my own from scratch. I came up with the following areas to collect data from these boards:
1. Deck Material
2. Deck Size
3. Battery (Wh/V/)
4. Motor Power (
5. Trucks Length/Width

# About Me
Hello! My name is Andrew Villapudua, a second year student at UC San Diego. I am currently studying Math-CS in John Muir College. I am a student-athlete in both Cross Country and Track & Field. In my time moving from Los Angeles where I grew up, to moving down to San Diego for college, I had time to develop hobbies such as surfing and skating. 
# Overview
Over the course of a few months, I plan on forming, developing, and executing a plan to build a functioning electric skateboard. This project aims to challenge my researching skills, problem-solving ability, and hardware knowledge I have developed over the past few years in school, as well as expanding my current knowledge of batteries, motors, structural integrity, etc.
# Research
With a price range in mind, I chose to work with electric skateboards in the range of 400-600 dollars, as I assumed it would be less expsensive to assemble a board on my own with the raw materials. I came up with the following areas to collect data from these boards:
1. Deck Material
2. Deck Size
3. Battery
4. Motor 
5. Add on to this as more ideas arise
### Deck Material
A wooden deck is composed of 5-11 layers of wood stacked on top of eachother, held together by an adhesive. The amount of layers used to construct the deck is dependent on the type of wood as well as the users preference. After conducting research over multiple sites across the web, I was able to narrow down my search to 3 different materials. The first being hard rock maple veneer, offering a strong, sturdy deck choice made for fast, downhill cruising styles. The second being bamboo that offers a lightweight, flexible option perfect for users looking for a deck that can handle rocky paths with ease and sharp turns. Lastly, birch offers a medium to the user which offers the capabilities of both the maple or bamboo deck, but the drawback is that it does not quite achieve the full capabilites of either material. Personally, I am looking for a deck that can handle high speeds over smooth surfaces, therefore maple is the best choice for this project. 
### Deck Size
For the most part, the size of the deck is subjective. The vast majority of long boards I found within the price rance had a length of about 3 feet or ,9 meters, and a width of about 8 to 11 inches or 20 cm to 28 cm.
